    <h1>How to Train Your Dragon</h1>

    <p>
      Hiccup (Chris Sanders) is a Norse teenager from the island of Berk, where
      fighting dragons is a way of life. His progressive views and weird sense
      of humor make him a misfit, despite the fact that his father (Dean
      DeBlois) is chief of the clan. Tossed into dragon-fighting school,he
      endeavors to prove himself as a true Viking, but when he befriends an
      injured dragon he names Toothless, he has the chance to plot a new course
      for his people's future.
